#PairUp: Memory Card
This project began during Girl Develop It's PairUp meetup.
It started as the PairUp Javascript Level 3 Excercise.
Detail of the program requirement can be seen at http://www.pairuptocode.com/exercises/memorygame.html.
Essentially, the goal is to create a memory card game.
The cards are flip card when clicked.
If 2 cards matches, they stay up.
If not, they flip back down.

In addition to the basic requirements of the project, we also hope to create a theme option for the card images.
